# Exercise 00

In the first exercise the `Matrix` and `Vector` classes implement the basic arithmetic operations: **addition**, **subtraction**, and **scalar multiplication**. These operations adhere to the `Structure` interface described below.

## 1. **Structure Interface**

The `Structure` interface describes objects that support arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication) on their structure.

```typescript
export interface Structure<K, T> {
  add(other: T): T;
  sub(other: T): T;
  scl(scalar: K): T;
}
```

- Methods:
  - `add(other: T): T`: Adds another structure of the same type.
  - `sub(other: T): T`: Subtracts another structure of the same type.
  - `scl(scalar: K): T`: Multiplies the structure by a scalar.

## Implementations of Arithmetic Operations

### Addition (`add`) and Subtraction (`sub`)

The `add` and `sub` methods follow a similar approach for both `Matrix` and `Vector` types, requiring element-wise operations. However, due to the absence of **operator overloading** in TypeScript, manual type checks are necessary to ensure compatibility across different data types like `number`, `bigint`, and custom types implementing the [`Arithmetic`](./core-structures#_2-arithmetic-interface) interface.

#### Type Checking in `add` and `sub`

Both `add` and `sub` perform type checking in the same manner. First, the method checks the size compatibility between the two structures. If they match, element-wise operations are performed.

```typescript
if (typeof value === 'number' && typeof otherValue === 'number') {
	this.values[i] = (value + otherValue) as K;
} else if (typeof value === 'bigint' && typeof otherValue === 'bigint') {
	this.values[i] = (value + otherValue) as K;
} else {
	(this.values[i] as Arithmetic) = (value as Arithmetic).add((otherValue as Arithmetic));
}
```

### 4. **Scalar Multiplication (`scl`)**

The `scl` method multiplies each element of a matrix or vector by a scalar. Similar to `add` and `sub`, type checks are necessary due to the lack of operator overloading in TypeScript.

## Example Usage

### Matrix Addition and Subtraction

```typescript
const matrix1 = new Matrix<number>([[1, 2], [3, 4]]);
const matrix2 = new Matrix<number>([[1, 1], [1, 1]]);
const added = matrix1.add(matrix2);
const subtracted = matrix1.sub(matrix2);

console.log(added.values); // [[2, 3], [4, 5]]
console.log(subtracted.values); // [[0, 1], [2, 3]]
```

### Vector Scalar Multiplication

```typescript
const vector = new Vector<number>([1, 2, 3]);
const scaled = vector.scl(2);

console.log(scaled.values); // [2, 4, 6]
```

## Challenges with TypeScript

### Lack of Operator Overloading

In languages like C++ or Python, operator overloading allows you to define how operators such as `+`, `-`, and `*` behave for custom types. However, TypeScript lacks native support for operator overloading, which means we must manually implement these operations using methods like `add`, `sub`, and `scl`.

### Type Inference and Custom Types

TypeScript's type inference works well for primitive types, but when dealing with more complex types (like custom arithmetic types), explicit type checks are necessary. This leads to somewhat verbose and repetitive code when handling multiple numeric types (`number`, `bigint`, and custom `Arithmetic` types). While this approach ensures correctness, it lacks the elegance seen in languages that natively support operator overloading.
