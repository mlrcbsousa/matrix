# Introduction

Used this project to learn `Rust`.

Started with the approach of coming from `TypeScript` with the help of front end masters the primeagen course **Rust for TypeScript Developers** `<link>`.

So using this project as first application of newly learned Rust knowledge whilst also doing it in TypeScript just because that comes more naturally and to continue the theme of Rust & TypeScript.
